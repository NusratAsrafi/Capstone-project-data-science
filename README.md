The cost effective space travel company is SpaceX. The company make spaceship in two stages. In the first stage the spaceship is made and the payload of the spaceship 
enclosed with the fairings. In the second stage The payload apart from the space station and moves into the orbits. The first stage is very long and expensive. The 
company reduces the cost of  spaceship less than twice from ordinary spaceship by reusing first stage of spaceship launch. If we can find out whether first stage of 
spaceship is successfully landed or not, we can make the price estimation of  most cost effective spaceship.
Data Science Process To solve the problem

Data Collection-API and Web Scraping

Data prepocess-EDA (data visualization and SQL)

Data Visualization-Map with Folium,Interactive Dash Board with plotly Dash

Predictive Analysis-ML models( logistic Regression , SVM, Decision Tree, KNN ).GridSearch

Results- The successful launch depends on several factors for example  launch site, orbit, payload mass etc. As the flight number and years increases the 
landing becomes more successful. From EDA we found The ES-L1,Geo,Heo and SS0 are orbits for successful landing. Payload is another factor for successful 
launch landing. For successful launch we need light payload. There is no successful landing for  VAFB-SLC launch site on heavy payloads. From the dataset 
we cannot explain which   launch site is better than others. We need to incorporate more attribute for it. From modelling experiment ,from the four model, 
decision tree performs best as it is best training accuracy.
